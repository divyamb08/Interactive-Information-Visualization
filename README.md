# Interactive-Information-Visualization
This project uses d3.js and javascript to plot the latitudes and longitudes of various nobel laureates in the world. The visualization is interactive and the locations of the latitudes and the longitudes change and shift in real time on the map. This visualization also shows how to use dropdowns and filter data to get the required visualization.
